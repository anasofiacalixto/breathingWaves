# breathingWaves
Repo for the interactive installation Breathing Waves of Mythic Light, developed for Goldsmiths University of London


**In short**
_breathing waves of mythic light_ is an installation that explores sensations in between life and death, a space where waves of light guide an active meditation, while they experience being on Charon's boat in a journey to the underworld. The prompt was to create an interactive work on the topics of duration (seconds, phase, repetition, rhythms, cycles) using Javascript. A teaser can be seen at: https://vimeo.com/905013561 
 
**Concept and Background Research**
The installation is inspired by the myth of Charonâ€™s boat, in which the audience travels through a constantly changing space and gets in touch with past versions of themselves.
The room has five screens with projections that change over time. The project approaches the concept of time by working with overlapping projections of themselves, filmed a few moments before, so that they face a past version of themselves - the space interacts with the participant, not the opposite. Over the course of 10 minutes, the space looks more unusual and the sensation of immersion is more intense.
The inspiration comes from computational works that embrace the sense of infinity and absurd spaces that are made possible when working with tech. The intention was to combine this tool with the reflection on the process of death, and how this could be resignified beyond the tragic nature of the subject. 


**Technical Implementation**
The project is as analog as it can be. The visuals are generated in VS Code, and the process of ever-growing waves starts when the coin is pushed down and this presses a keyboard. An audio is then played manually. The overlapping projections of the person are made with a second code, also triggered manually, in which a camera in front of the participant films them and after a delay, is projected on top of the waves. Key the coin is pressed again, the visuals go back to the starting point.


**Reflection and Future Development**
During the process, I learned to embrace mistakes and glitches, and explore them creatively - in other words, working with code, rather than using code. I had a few ideas that were limited because of technical difficulties, two of them being a challenge that I want to overcome in the future of this project.
The first is creating a realistic coin made of resin with a NFC tag in it, so that the visuals are activated only when it is placed in the front of the boat. The idea was also to sculpt a human face with an open mouth, so the coin would be placed inside of it. The difficulty was combining NFC tags and triggers within the code.
The other was to have a tunnel like generative drawing in the middle of the screen, and keeping the waves low. The idea was that the waves were in the 3D mesh in the front, and the generative tunnel was between the waves and the background.
In the future, I would like to dedicate some time to the scenography, applying reflective materials on the floor and ceiling, so that the space is fully immersive, as well as building a more aesthetic boat front to the space.
